            The theory behind Lean is not hard to understand. Many companies
            struggle when they try to go from theory and talking – to implement
            Lean in practice. In 80% of change programs within industry,
            companies fail to reach sustainable over a long time – 1 to 3 years
            after program is completed. Why is that?
            <br />
            <br />
            You will find the answer in management and leader behaviour and the
            understanding of different roles in the company on different levels
            to be able to continue to drive continuous improvement. To
            understand your role as a leader and be able to drive and support
            improvements in praxis – to “walk the walk” – is the key to
            sustainable improvements over time.

            To achieve sustainable change on a world class level we will analyse
            the current situation and identify the gap towards world class. In
            every building block in the pyramid it is clearly described what
            world class means. Based on the result of the assessment we will
            develop a strategy and action plan together with your management

                  <br />A Lean leader challenges through driving continuous
                  improvement, going out to see in reality, developing teamwork
                  by asking questions and respects people (PDCA). There is a big
                  difference between Lean leadership and traditional leadership.
                  It is therefore crucial to achieving success that leaders
                  understand and can act as a Lean leader. To achieve this
                  requires training.

                  The introduction of standardized work requires that we

                  <br />
                  The methodology we use looks briefly as follows:

                  Radical improvements within safety, quality, delivery and cost
                  is a common result when standardized work is in place in an
                  organization.
                  <br />
                  <br />

                  A common mistake is to think that it is enough to have great

                  Then standardized work will be a paper product, which is all
                  too common. The possible effect of standardized work has not
                  been released, which is a shame because that is what you want.
                  <br />
                  It is therefore essential to respect that as part of the
                  introduction we have to train those who will work with the
                  standards practically. This is done through a highly effective
                  methodology used by the best companies in the world.

                  Job observations means that we implement a visual system for

                  to control the condition of you equipment leading to an early
                  identification of problems. Downtime in your value stream will

                  <br />
                  A proper functioning operator’s maintenance will also lead to
                  that the Maintenance organization can go from “firefighting”

                  Kaizen comes from the Japanese words Kai and Zen. Kai means
                  change or to correct and Zen means good. Kaizen simply means
                  good change meaning improvement.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Kaizen in a business or factory means that you have created a
                  system where all employees are included, from top management
                  to each operator. All are encouraged to come with small
                  improvement suggestions on a regular basis. This is not a
                  campaign for one month or one year. It is sustainable. Toyota
                  has 60-70 proposals per employee and year, documented, shared
                  and implemented.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Kaizen is based upon that we regularly make small changes
                  systematically to improve safety, quality, efficiency and
                  productivity by eliminating waste in processes. In order to do
                  this we need to understand and be able to see waste in
                  processes. That is why training is extremely important in
                  order to succeed, such as Gemba walks.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  This is the opposite of “if it is not broken, don´t fix it” as
                  often is the basic philosophy of many companies.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Kaizen philosophy is “do it better, make it better, improve it
                  even if is not broken, because if we don’t we can’t compete
                  with those who do”.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Kaizen means that we will build a system of continuous
                  improvement involving everyone at all levels in the company.
                  What would your business look like in 3 years if all employees
                  contributed with 60-70 improvement suggestions per year?
